[[ROS_based localization of a race vehicle at highspeed using LIDAR.pdf]]

The presented approach allows LIDAR based
localization at high speeds.
# Related work
Different approaches are describe. Different combinations of 3D lidars, 2D lidar or imus are used, however few apporaches seem to trulelly test these approaches at a very high speed.

# New Terms
- Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) algorithm\
# High-Speed LIDAR localisation
## Measurement update
- A crucial is issue for high speed is the computational time
- Methods to help with this includes:
	- Limit number of paarticles $M$ measured
	- Reduce amount of LIDAR beams to be processed
## Motion update 

# Conclusion
