- What is the paper about in our own words?
	 - The paper aims to unify F1Tenth racing by surveying advances in different approaches, describing common methods, providing benchmark results to facilitate comparison and establish a baseline for future work. It provides an overview of what is currently being done in the field and how it is connected. It aims to provide a more unified approach and overview to the field as researchers often isolate themselves in certain aspects of the field.
- What are the best parts of it?
	- A thorough study and comparison of he methods that have been used by others (Table 1) 
	- It shows where there are potential gaps in the research and where there is room for improvement
	- The diagrams are very informative and well thought out. It supports the understanding and statement in the text well.
	
- What parts are difficult to understand?
	- No parts were particularly difficult to understand. Instances that seemed vague, are more due to unfamiliarity with some terms and concepts. 
	- 
- What is at least one thing you think needs improving?
	- This is very picky but not really a big deal. Fig 2 and 3 have the speedometer icon with white background while the steering wheel is blended in with the background of the bubble. This looks a little bit strange considering the two icons are in the same style.
	- Page 7 refers to Fig 14 as the red intensity while in the figure it is green?

Questions:
- How do you make these diagrams and images (What do you use?)
- What exactly is the control frequency? - How many times it calculates the state and control? Is there any significance in running it at a certain frequency instead of as fast as possible?
