#### Binary classifiers
- True positive and true negatives are desired

#### Time-to-collision
$$
						TTC_i(t)= \frac{r_i(t)}{[\dot{r}_i(t)]}_+ 
$$
where r is range between vehicle and object 
- Note $TTCi(t)=\infty$  for $\dot{r}_i(t)>=0$ 

#### Range-rate
$$\dot{r}_i=v_{x}cos(\theta_{i})$$
where $v_x$ is forward speed in vehicles reference frame multiplied by cosine of the beam's angle
