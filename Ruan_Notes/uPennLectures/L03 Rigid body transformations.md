#### Why do we need frame transformations
- Sensors provide measurements specific to its frame of reference
	- Mapping is done by tying sub maps together

Consider offsets of sensors relative to frame of robot

Reference frames:
- Map frame
- Base link frame
- Sensor frame

Math stuff: 
- Rotation matrices (Might become useful during coding)
